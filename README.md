# Course-Planner
## Inspiration
As college students ourselves, we realized the need for an organized and easy course planner.

## What it does
Say that you are majoring in Physics B.S, so our website will provide the table of courses you need to take in order to graduate with that degree instead of looking up the university's website. If you're aiming to do a double degree/dual major, our website will provide three tables: the excluded courses of your first major, the excluded courses of your second, and the courses that the two degrees share. 

Our website can keep track of what course you're doing and you can do all of the shared courses, and if you're undecided about taking a double major/dual degree or not, you can do the courses on the shared list before deciding on one.

## How we built it
We build our own database (CSV files) based on the list of courses on the UB website via Google Sheets and we build the back-end of the website by using Python. For the front-end, we use JavaScript, and HTML/CSS to build the website.

## What we learned
We learned how to piece together our knowledge of front-end development, back-end development, and databases to create the final product

## What's next for Course Planner
Expand the available database, and possibly write Python script that would allow for any course data to be formatted and used in the program.
